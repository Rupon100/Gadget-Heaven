## List of React Fundamental  concept i use there
* React Router (useLoaderData): Fetched and     accessed route-based data directly in components.
* Local Storage Integration: Saved and retrieved wishlist data from local storage to persist user selections across sessions.
* useState: Used to manage component-level state, like tracking the wishlist items.
* useEffect: Handles side effects in the component, such as fetching data or updating the UI after state changes.
* Props: Passed data from parent to child components, like item details in SingleWishList.
* Component Reusability: Created reusable components like SingleWishList to display individual items.
* Array Methods (map, filter): Used to display lists of items and filter out removed items dynamically.
* Conditional Rendering: Rendered different content based on conditions, such as displaying a message when the wishlist is empty.
